Here we are, embarking on a new start to research life @ AR4004. Research should never be done alone, sparsely, remotely detached from the thoroughfare of interests among us. For if we fail to synergise, we will find ourselves isolated, having too little time for everything, and short of inspiration. 

**Visual Processing Lab** or ViPr Lab (just say, "viper") is what we set out to do. A gathering of like minded people working on anything *visual* that needs *processing*, be it images or videos, visualizations or interfaces, applications that are lightweight or heavy simulations that pack a punch.

Our ethos revolves around the following points that we think are essential to build a strong research group:

- Supporting faculty-postgraduate-undergraduate research cohesion
- Conducive research environment
- Paper reading group -- Learn to do better research by first...reading more.
