### Long-term Video Surveillance (LoViS)

{% include imagethumbnailblock.html align="left" url="/images/lovis.png" width="120px" height="120px"  %}
In a long-term period, video surveillance takes on a different perspective. Habitual behaviors of people or permanent changes to objects can be observed while anomalous "out-of-norm" variations can also be traced. We investigate how these variational patterns can be extracted over a long period of time to gain a high-level understanding of various factors at play.

### Action Recognition in Adverse Quality Surveillance (AQuaS)

Most state-of-the-art techniques for HAR have been designed to perform well under constrained and highly controlled conditions. However, these capabilities may not be easily replicable in real-world surveillance conditions (via devices such as CCTV or web cameras) where video quality may be naturally poor. We investigate new representations for recognizing human activities in adverse quality surveillance videos.

### Large-scale Aesthetic Evaluation of Photographs (LAttE)

Image aesthetic evaluation is a research field which aims to design computationally-driven methods which can automatically rate or predict the perceived aesthetic quality of an image or photograph by learning from image content, photographic rules and other semantic information. We investigate how features can be learned in an unsupervised manner as opposed to traditional hand-crafted rules, and design new deep learning architectures to evaluate the aesthetic beauty of photographs.
